# Sports Classification

This repository is made for practice Vision computing using 100 sports classification dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification

Used python 3.8 and `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to install dependencies in order to execute properly this file. Maybe some packages are not used, this is because I am working on 4-5 projects at the same time and I have created a requirements.txt for all of them.

## To know
- TF_Sports_Classifier, has been made in my local, using CUDA and Tensorflow. with 2 conv-pool layers and 3 dense layers, being the last one, the output.
